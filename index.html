# An operating system is a <strong>program that provides a platform for other programs</strong>. It provides two things to these programs: .highlight[abstractions] and .highlight[isolation].

# abstractions

---

# common abstractions

these are some common abstractions provided by an operating system and/or kernel:

- address spaces
- memory protection
- processes
- files
- input/output devices
